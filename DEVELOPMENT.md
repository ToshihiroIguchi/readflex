# Development Notes

## Background

This package addresses the common problem of reading CSV files with various character encodings, particularly when working with international datasets.

## Design Decisions

### Modular Architecture
The package uses a modular architecture where each major feature set is in its own file. This makes maintenance easier and allows users to load only the features they need.

### Backward Compatibility
All enhancements maintain full backward compatibility with the original readflex() function. Users can opt into new features gradually.

### Dependency Management
Optional dependencies are handled gracefully - the package works with base R but provides enhanced features when additional packages are available.

## Testing Strategy

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Multiple language character sets
- Various file formats and encodings
- Performance benchmarks
- Error conditions and edge cases
